# LOG-kernel-based-Edge-Detector
This project is a part of VLSI Design LAB (EE-705) course at IIT Bombay. This project is implemented in VHDL and some of the python scripts are available to view the demo of edge detection in python, and also some utility scripts for preprocess the data like converting image to binary bit vectors and postprocess the data like converting binary bit vectors  back into image and display using python. And also some of scripts for scaling of resolutions, etc. Main components which are built in VHDL are 2D convolution unit, generic floating point adder and multiplication unit, etc.
